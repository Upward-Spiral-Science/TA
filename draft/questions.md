###Types of Questions

**Descriptive** <br />
*Which processing strategy produces the highest same-study descriminability for each dataset?*

**Exploratory** <br />
*Is there a common processing strategy for which same-study descriminability is maximized across uniquely collected datasets?*

**Inferential** <br />
*Does processing uniquely obtainted datasets uniformly increase the cross-study descriminability of the aggregate dataset?*

**Predictive** <br />
*Are there features of the data that indicate which processing strategy will provide the highest same-study descriminability?*

**Causal** <br />
*Does processing the datasets differently have an effect on the cross-study descriminability?*

**Mechanistic** <br />
*What properties does the processing strategy with the best cross-study descriminability introduce to the data which makes it successful?*

####Notes:

**same-study descriminability**: Descriminability while using datapoints within a uniformly collected dataset. <br/>
**cross-study descriminability**: Descriminability while using datapoints across separate datasets, each of which has been uniformly collected.
