This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{python}
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import collections
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{python}
import os
dnames = list(['../data/MRN114', '../data/KKI2009', '../data/SWU4'])
print "Datasets: " + ", ".join(dnames)
print "D = " + str(len(dnames))

# Getting graph names
fs = dict()
for dd in dnames:
        fs[dd] = [root+'/'+fl for root, dir, files in os.walk(dd) for fl in files if fl.endswith(".graphml")]
# fs[dnames[1]]
```

```{python}
print fs
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
